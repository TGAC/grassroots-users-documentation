The Grassroots Infrastructure project wraps up industry-standard software tools with a consistent API that can be federated on a number of levels. This means institutions and groups can deploy a simple lightweight virtual machine, expose local data, connect up any existing data services, and federate their instance of the Grassroots with others out-of-the-box.</p> <p>The Grassroots Infrastructure uses a controlled vocabulary of JSON messages to communicate, so any server or client that can understand JSON can be used to access and connect to the platform.

Typically this information is collected within spreadsheets and Work Package 4 (WP4) has been working with field managers and biologists to standardise these spreadsheets and collection mechanisms. The standards we have produced follow the same concepts as the Breeding API (BrAPI), a technical solution to use these standards to make genotyping, phenotyping and trial data interoperable and reusable.</p> <p>The top level of the BrAPI hierarchy is a Programme which, initially for us, is the DFW programme.  We can store non-DFW data and create the relevant Programmes for such data, however our initial focus is on DFW data.</p> <p>Each Programme can contain one or more Trials, which BrAPI defines as the equivalent of an  \"investigation\" in the Minimal Information about a Plant Phenotyping Experiment (MIAPPE) standard.</p> <p>Trials can consist of one or more experiments where seeds are sown and phenotypic information is gathered and each of these is called a Study.  These contain a variety of data, such as weather information, experimental design notes and each Study takes place at a Location.  To add a Study to the system you need to define both the Field Trial that it is part of and the Location where it took place.</p> <p>For each Study, you can specify the set of phenotypes that will be measured and these are called Measured Phenotype Variables. Each of these consist of unique triples (three distinct pieces of information) that define:</p> <ol> <li>A phenotype</li> <li>How it has been measured </li> <li>Which units have been used</li> </ol> <p>When you have specified the phenotypes to use, these are submitted as Plots, along with the details of how the experiment has been laid out in the field.  Plots contain various details such as width, length, position in field, phenotypic data, etc.</p> <p>All of the uploaded data is available in our field trial search portal which allows you to search across all Studies and view individual Studies in more detail.</p> <p>The various services are described in more detail below, however for easy access, the links to each of the services are:</p>"},{"location":"field_trial/#registering-an-orcid","title":"Registering an ORCID","text":"<p>To submit data into the DFW Field Trial system, you need to have an ORCID - a unique identifier that can be used to record your institution, affiliations, funding, publications, etc. ORCIDs are becoming favoured by funders, journals, and services like Grassroots because it allows: </p> <ul> <li>science outputs to be attributable to an individual even if they move employment and </li> <li>the use of ORCIDs as an authentication mechanism to identify people who are able to use specific services. </li> </ul> <p>In this case, we can attribute your field trials to you as collectors of this information within DFW, but also control who is able to submit data thus preventing people from gaining access to the system. </p> <p>Registering for an ORCID takes a couple of minutes and will not expose any personal information about you.

These dates can be in one of two formats: one for a day and one for a specfic time on a day.</p> <p>For dates that refer to a day the format is YYYY-MM-DD, where YYYY is the 4-digit year, MM is the 2-digit month and DD is the 2-digit day of the month.

By default, the values within a column are assumed to be raw values. You can change these to corrected values by adding corrected (all lower case) within the column header. </p> <p>You can also store multiple data points for a given trait in a given plot, for example plant heights from 5 different points within a plot. This is done by adding sample_n within the column header where n is a number starting starting from 1 and going on to 2, 3, 4, etc. as needed. When this is omitted, samples have a default index of 1.</p> <p>Some examples are given below:</p> Column Description PH_M_cm Plant height on unspecified date PH_M_cm 2020-12-01 Plant height measured on 01 Dec 2020 PH_M_cm 2020-12-01 2020-12-03 Plant height measured on 01 Dec 2020 to 03 Dec 202 PH_M_cm corrected Plant height corrected value on unspecified date PH_M_cm 2020-12-01T09:30:00 Plant height measured on at 9:30 AM on 01 Dec 2020 PH_M_cm 2020-12-01T09:30:00 2020-12-03T12:15:30 Plant height measured from 9:30 AM 01 Dec 2020 to 12:15:30 PM on 03 Dec 2020 PH_M_cm 2020-12-01T09:30:00 corrected Corrected plant height measured on at 9:30 AM on 01 Dec 2020 PH_M_cm 2020-12-01T09:30:00 2020-12-03T12:15:30 corrected Corrected plant height measured from 9:30 AM 01 Dec 2020 to 12:15:30 PM on 03 Dec 2020 PH_M_cm 2020-12-01T09:30:00 sample_1 A sample Plant height measured on at 9:30 AM on 01 Dec 2020 to be stored with an index of 1 PH_M_cm 2020-12-01T09:30:00 sample_2 A sample Plant height measured on at 9:30 AM on 01 Dec 2020 to be stored with an index of 2"},{"location":"field_trial/submit_programme/","title":"Submitting programme","text":"<p>Programmes consist of one or more Field Trials.
